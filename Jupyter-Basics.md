### The installation of Jupyter has already been covered in `How-to-Install-Anaconda.md`

 - Jupyter Notebook is good for data science, scientific computing, machine learning, and other types of applications.

 - On the top of the page, there is the word `Untitled`. Simply click on it to edit the title of your Jupyter notebook.
 - Notice how the first line of your notebook has `In [ ]`? It means what you are typing is an input.
 - To run what you type, do Shift+Enter (press both at the same time) or click the Run button up at the top.
 - For the other basic features of Jupyter, here's a good website to look at! (not owned or sponsored, just a good resource) https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-tutorial-to-jupyter-notebooks-1b2f8705888a
