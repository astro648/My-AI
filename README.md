# My AI
I am learning the basics of AI, data science, arrays and matrices, scientific computing, and a lot more topics with this project. My goal is to be able to have a good handle on the basics of AI, scientific computing, and data sciences and be able to keep learning after this project is complete.
I will be regularly updating the documentation and code until I am done with this.

## What am I using?
- Anaconda - From Wikipedia: "`Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.`" Install instructions are listed in `How-to-Install-Anaconda.md` in the main directory.
- Jupyter - used to edit .ipynb / Jupyter Notebook files
- NumPy - From Wikipedia: "`NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.`"
- Matplotlib - From Wikipedia: "`Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.`"
- Pandas - "`pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.`"

There are instructions on how to set up Anaconda and start a new project in `Beginning-the-Project.md`, also in the main directory.
